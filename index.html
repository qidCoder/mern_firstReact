    <!-- First, we have a string that contains h1. This tells React which element we want to create, in this case it is an h1 html element. Next, we have empty curly braces where we will pass props. Lastly, we send in the children. This is what we want to create within our h1 tag. This could be a list of many different children, but for now we are just sending in a string.

 <!-- After we define the App method, we call ReactDOM.render. We are telling React to display our App component within the element that has an id of root. -->
